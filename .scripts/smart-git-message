Convert this git diff into a concise, lowercase commit message following the conventional commit idiom.
- Try to find a scope under which the changes can be summarized, and add them after the conventional commit type. For changes scoped to a single file, use the file name (without extension) as the scope. Example: feat(keymaps): <summary>.
- If changes are not scoped to a single file or no sensible scope can be found, skip the scope and just use the commit type. Example: feat: <summary>.
- If an issue number is found in the branch name, prefix the message with the capitalized issue number. Example: BCD-2565 feat(<optional scope>): <summary>.
